All Simplx managed hosting customers will now have increased protections against DDOS (Distributed denial of service) attacks as a temporary measure. There has been a significant increase in ransom-driven DDOS cyber crime from entities claiming to be Fancy Bear / Cozy Bear / Lazarus, and we are concerned that these attacks may affect our customers.

## How prepared are you?

From the Australian Cyber Security Centre:

*Organisations should ask themselves the following questions to determine how prepared they are to respond to cyber security incidents:*

- *Have we identified systems and information critical to our business operations?*
- *Do we have business continuity and disaster recovery plans?*
- *Do we have an up‚Äêto‚Äêdate and regularly tested incident response plan?*
- *Do our agreements with service providers include cyber security incident reporting and response activities?*
- *Do we have the ability to detect when cyber security incidents may have occurred?*
- *How easily and quickly can we access appropriate resources to respond to cyber security incidents?*
- *What are our legislative obligations in regards to reporting cyber security incidents?*
- *Who has the primary responsibility for cyber security incident reporting, and do we have standard operating procedures in place?*

## How Simplx fights cyber crime and protects your business

1. State of the art security software (Wordfence) on your website, which includes an application firewall.
2. Two-factor authentication, automatic lockouts and non-accessible login pages thwart brute force attacks and even identity fraud.
3. CDN level security makes DDoS attacks significantly less severe.
4. GDPR compliant internal data handling and encrypted transfer for passwords.
5. Security and privacy first design thinking in our products, services and subprocessor choices.

## What do I do in the event of a DDoS attack or DDoS ransom?

If your business is targeted by DDOS ransom cyber crime, **there is no need to panic.**

1. **Do not pay any ransom** - there is no way to guarantee that you will not be attacked even after paying the ransom, and it shows attackers that this form of crime can pay off, increasing attack rates.
2. **Contact the Australian Cyber Security Centre and file a report** if you're an Australian company or individual. You can also file a report at your local police station. If your company is based in the US, contact the FBI Cyber Division. Once a report is filed, you should receive a response on how to proceed.
3. **Contact our helpdesk and submit a high priority ticket.** We can help mitigate the DDOS attack and help to protect your business with Cloudflare or similar technology, and will contact our upstream providers.

Please note that DDOS ransom attacks usually don't mean the malicious entities have compromised your website, and there is no reason to believe data has been hacked unless intrusion is detected.


## **Our approach to intrusion cyber crime**

üîí Secure - Patch the leak immediately, and attempt to minimise its impact.

üì£ Disclose - Fully announce the situation and provide live updates as new information is discovered.

üßæ Recover - Work with those affected to compensate or recover any losses

## **Legal implications**

Simplx does not guarantee the security of your web server, and uptime SLAs do not apply to DDOS attacks.
