## What is a DDoS attack?
You can learn more about DDoS from the [Australia Cyber Security Centre.](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/threats/denial-service)

## How prepared is your businesss?
From the Australian Cyber Security Centre:

*Organisations should ask themselves the following questions to determine how prepared they are to respond to cyber security incidents:*

- *Have we identified systems and information critical to our business operations?*
- *Do we have business continuity and disaster recovery plans?*
- *Do we have an up‐to‐date and regularly tested incident response plan?*
- *Do our agreements with service providers include cyber security incident reporting and response activities?*
- *Do we have the ability to detect when cyber security incidents may have occurred?*
- *How easily and quickly can we access appropriate resources to respond to cyber security incidents?*
- *What are our legislative obligations in regards to reporting cyber security incidents?*
- *Who has the primary responsibility for cyber security incident reporting, and do we have standard operating procedures in place?*

1. State of the art security software (Wordfence) on your website, which includes an application firewall.
2. Two-factor authentication, automatic lockouts and non-accessible login pages thwart brute force attacks and even identity fraud.
3. CDN level security makes DDoS attacks significantly less severe.
4. GDPR compliant internal data handling and encrypted transfer for passwords.
5. Security and privacy first design thinking in our products, services and subprocessor choices.

## What do I do in the event of a DDoS attack or DDoS ransom?

If your business is targeted by DDOS ransom cyber crime, **there is no need to panic.**

1. **Do not pay any ransom** - there is no way to guarantee that you will not be attacked even after paying the ransom, and it shows attackers that this form of crime can pay off, increasing attack rates.
2. **Contact the Australian Cyber Security Centre and file a report** if you're an Australian company or individual. You can also file a report at your local police station. If your company is based in the US, contact the FBI Cyber Division. Once a report is filed, you should receive a response on how to proceed.
3. **Contact our helpdesk and submit a high priority ticket.** We can help mitigate the DDOS attack and help to protect your business with Cloudflare or similar technology, and will contact our upstream providers.

:::important

Please note that DDOS ransom attacks usually don't mean the malicious entities have compromised your website, and there is no reason to believe data has been hacked unless intrusion is detected.

## **Legal implications**

Simplx does not guarantee the security of your web server, and uptime SLAs do not apply to DDOS attacks.
