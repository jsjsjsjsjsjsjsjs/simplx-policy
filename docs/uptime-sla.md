We offer an industry-leading service level agreement (SLA) for website uptime. Our goal is to achieve 100% website availability across all services and for all customers. Our network is fully redundant, utilizes enterprise-grade hardware, and is assembled of self-healing infrastructure.

## Remedy
We will issue an account credit to your Simplx plan if the website availability is less than 100%, based on the following:

### For Alpha, Bravo & Charlie Plans (2.0.0)
 Website avaliability        | Monthly downtime      | Credit Percentage |
| ------------- | :-----------: | -----: |
| 100% - 99.9%      | Up to 44 minutes | 0% |
| 99.9% to 98%      |   Between 44 minutes and 14 hours 52 minutes    |   15% |
| 98% to 95% |   Between 14 hours 53 minutes and 37 hours 12 minutes    |    30% |
| 95% to 90% | Between 37 hours 13 minutes and 74 hours 24 minutes    |    65% |
| Less than 90% | More than 74 hours 25 minutes    |    100% |

The credit amount will be calcuated on the monthly Service fee, minus any discounts, addons or licenses which have been applied.

## Exceptions
Customers are not entitled to a remedy under this SLA if website availability is reduced or impaired due to any of the following exceptions in this agreement.

- The SLA does not apply to Google Workspace or other addons.
- Circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to, acts of government, war, insurrection, sabotage, armed conflict, fire, flood, strike/labor action, delays in transportation, delays in partner telecommunications networks, failure of third party software, and Denial of Service attacks.
- Scheduled maintenance or upgrades, including in emergencies.
- DNS propogation outside of our direct control.
- Issues with FTP, SSH, POP3, IMAP and SMTP.
- SLA breaches reported by third-party monitoring services belonging to the customer.
- Excessive resource consumption.
- Outages elsewhere on the internet, DNS caching, browser caching, or any other reason that hinders access to the service while others can still access it.

## Maintenance
We will perform scheduled maintenance at a time which is deemed suitable (usually off-peak), and should the service be offline for greater than 30 minutes, we will post details of the maintenance at least 2 days prior. These periods are not included in the SLA.

## Changes
We may amend this agreement at any time, and will notify you when we do so. You can check the date this document was last updated below.
