## Maintaing good business partnerships with our down-stream providers
Bandwidth in Australia is significantly more expensive when compared to the USA, but by maintaining good business relations with like-minded providers we can pass on savings to our customers.

## Sustainability
We vet our providers and their subprocessors for climate responsibility when making business decisions or carrying out tender processes. Our current connections make Simplx a sustainable and environmentally-friendly network for all our customers, so they can have confidence their websites aren't diminishing from our Earth.

## Our providers
We use two primary providers for our web hosting services:

Flywheel is a managed WordPress hosting service that makes use of powerful Google infrastructure. We elect to have our sites hosted in Google Cloud Platform's Sydney datacentre. Technical specifics relating to GCP infrastructure are confidential, as are the exact locations of the PoPs. Flywheel Cloud Platform includes auto-healing technology, instant scaling, FlyCache, mission-critical uptime and Fastly CDN. This platform is not shared hosting, with individual resources for every single hosted website, and shared load balancers.

We are proud members of the Flywheel Agency Partner program.
