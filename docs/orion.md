## What is DSCM?
Digital Service Content Management (DSCM) is a custom Simplx tool that you can use to edit your website and digital services. 

### Previous names
1.0.0 Simplx plans previously used the legacy Service Management, Inventory and Content Management System (SMICMS) to manage their website. This portal has now been retired.
