## Check our system status

To see if a site loading problem is a system-wide issue, check our [status page.](https://jessicasutherlanddesign.statuspage.io/) 

## Check Google Cloud status

Simplx uses Google Cloud for hosting. Although their status is integrated into our status page, please check the [Google Cloud status page.](https://status.cloud.google.com/)

## Check your local connection

If your site is loading slowly on pages with small amounts of content and your browser is up-to-date, there could be an issue with your local network.

If you can, try viewing your site on another network. If you have good cell coverage, you can also try accessing your site from a smartphone with the Wi-Fi disabled.

You can also troubleshoot this with a [speed test.](http://speedtest.net) If your upload and download speeds are lower than what your Internet service provider has promised, contact them to see if there might be an issue.

## Try again in a peak period

We perform updates in off-peak periods (early morning). If your browsing around this time, there is a rare chance your site has slowed down. Try again in ~15 minutes.

## Check for other causes

A variety of other factors can affect your site's load time. This includes:

- Computer memory/capacity
- External scripts added to the site
- Local network firewalls
- Anti-virus software
- Browser add-ons
- Issues with third-party domain providers
- Weather, cable faults, construction, network maintenance or other physical events

Try temporarily disabling any browser extensions, clearing your cache anti-virus software, and external scripts that may be impacting your site.

**Speed of your internet can be impacted by:**

- Number of users sharing the same connection
- The type of activities done (streaming, downloading, etc.)
- Your device type and specifications
- Your location and distance from the exchange
- Your network access (NBN, ADSL, Cable, etc.)
- Your in-home cabling
- The quality of the infrastructure
- Peak and Off-peak periods

# Use an up to date browser and operating system

- [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) - PC, Mac, and Linux
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/) - PC, Mac, and Linux
- [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) - Mac only
- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/microsoft-edge) - PC only

We do not support Microsoft Internet Explorer. It is depreciated and should not be used.

## Get in touch with us

If you've confirmed it's none of these things, please make a [request on our service desk.](https://jsjsjs.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1). Cases of slow sites are a high priority and should be resolved within 24-48 hours.

We run speed and up time tests frequently on all of our plans, so if your website is performing badly, we probably already know and are working to fix the issue.
