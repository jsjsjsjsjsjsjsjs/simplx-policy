Having trouble logging into DSCM? Try the troubleshooting steps below:

## Geographical protections
DSCM login is restricted to traffic coming from within Australia. On high-security websites, it may be limited to an IP address. If you are outside of Australia (on holiday etc), please contact us so we can temporarily remove this limitation.

## Forgot credentials
### Lost password
Forgot password? Don't worry, you can reset it.

1. Press 'Lost your password?' on the DSCM login screen.
2. Enter your username or email address.
3. If the email address is valid, you will recieve an email with further instructions. If you have not recieved this email and believe you should have, please get in touch.

:::note

Your new password will need to meet our strength requirements. Please store it securely and **do not share it with anyone.**

### Lost username/email address?
For security reasons, you cannot manually find this information. Please get in touch with us via our helpdesk and we can assist you through the recovery process.

## SAML SSO Misconfiguration/Invalid user
If you use SAML SSO with an identity provider like Google Workspace or Azure Active Directory and cannot login, your user/tenant may not have high enough privileges. There may also be a misconfiguration with the SAML setup, or an expired certificate.

## No longer have access to a two-factor-authentication (2FA) device/key
For security reasons, you cannot reset this key yourself. Get in touch with us and we can assist you with setting up a new 2FA method. Please make sure to never delete your website key from your 2FA app, and to keep a secure record of your backup keys.
