## Check our system status

To see if a site loading problem is a system-wide issue, check our [status page.](https://jessicasutherlanddesign.statuspage.io/) 

## Check Google Cloud status

Simplx uses Google Cloud for hosting. Please check the [Google Cloud status page.](https://status.cloud.google.com/)

## Check your local connection

If you can, try viewing your site on another network. If you have good cell coverage, you can also try accessing your site from a smartphone with the Wi-Fi disabled.

You can also troubleshoot this with a [speed test.](http://speedtest.net) If your upload and download speeds are lower than what your Internet service provider has promised, contact them to see if there might be an issue.

## Check for other causes

A variety of other factors can affect your site's load time. This includes:

- Computer memory/capacity
- External scripts added to the site
- Local network firewalls
- Anti-virus software
- Browser add-ons
- Issues with third-party domain providers
- Weather, cable faults, construction, network maintenance or other physical events

Try temporarily disabling any browser extensions, clearing your cache, disabling anti-virus software, and external scripts that may be impacting your site.

## Use an up to date browser and operating system

- [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) - Android, iOS, PC, Mac, and Linux
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/) - Android, iOS, PC, Mac, and Linux
- [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) - iOS and Mac
- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/microsoft-edge) - PC and Mac

:::caution

We do not support Microsoft Internet Explorer. It is depreciated and should not be used.
