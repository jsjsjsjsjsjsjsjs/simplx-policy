## Will my plan automatically renew?
Yes, your Simplx plan will automatically renew at the end of your billing cycle. After your plan renews, you will recieve an invoice via email. If you wish for it not to renew, please get in touch as soon as possible, because if we do renew your plan without you telling us otherwise, we cannot retract your invoice.

## When will my plan not be renwed?
If you have overdue invoices, your site is empty or we cannot contact you for an extended period of time, we will make a judgement call and not renew your plan.

## What is my billing day?
Your billing day is the day at the end of your billing cycle when payment is due. It will be the same month and date that you made your first payment.

## How long is my billing cycle?
Simplx billing cycles are exactly 12 months long (1 year).

### Monthly billing cycles
We currently do not offer a monthly plan for Simplx. By paying annually, you are saving around 20% compared to month-month pricing.
